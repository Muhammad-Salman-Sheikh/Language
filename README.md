# Language
I am developing a language, so this is my working place. The language's name is `SIMPLE`.

## Syntax
The syntax of the language is as follow :

		* Compute math expressions like usual, i.e `2 + 1`, `5 % 2` etc..
		
		* Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo (`%`), parenthesis.
		
		* To declare a variable simply type the variable's name, an equals sign and the number you want to assign it to.
        `( x = 12 )` will declare a variable `x` with a value of `12`.
	
		* Functions are declared with `Func nameOfFunc arg1 arg2 => ( return what ever )`

## Quirks
		* An empty program will display FizBuzz program ( exits with error )
		* A program containing any operator ( + , - , * , / , % ) but no numbers will display Hello World! and exit with error
